MeanBuy is the future of online shopping; we let our customers Pay What They Want to Pay on a variety of retail products, ranging from women’s accessories to consumer electronics on MeanBuy.com. Our disruptive, patent pending flexible pricing technology is based on multi-dimensional consumer behaviorism exemplified by today’s online shopper. 

iPrice, the enterprise level integrated solution brings this flexible, demand driven pricing model to large retailers driving much greater profits than traditional clearance or liquidation strategies.

We specialize in product price optimization, inventory turnover maximization, and are able to provide all of this while maintaining brand quality and customer loyalty. Our back-end has been designed and developed to optimally serve the needs of our merchants, offering them valuable demand driven pricing data, a fully customizable API ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and a highly automated system so as to minimize overhead. We stand by our clients and believe flexibility, quality, and innovation are the key factors to a long lasting business relationship.
